    abstract = {Graph databases have gained renewed interest in the last years, due to its applications in areas such as the Semantic Web and Social Networks Analysis. We study the problem of querying graph databases, and, in particular, the expressiveness and complexity of evaluation for several general-purpose query languages, such as the regular path queries and its extensions with conjunctions and inverses. We distinguish between two semantics for these languages. The first one, based on simple paths, easily leads to intractability, while the second one, based on arbitrary paths, allows tractable evaluation for an expressive family of languages.We also study two recent extensions of these languages that have been motivated by modern applications of graph databases. The first one allows to treat paths as first-class citizens, while the second one permits to express queries that combine the topology of the graph with its underlying data.},

    abstract = {The context-free language (CFL) reachability problem is a well-known fundamental formulation in program analysis. In practice, many program analyses, especially pointer analyses, adopt a restricted version of CFL-reachability, Dyck-CFL-reachability, and compute on edge-labeled bidirected graphs. Solving the all-pairs Dyck-CFL-reachability on such bidirected graphs is expensive. For a bidirected graph with n nodes and m edges, the traditional dynamic programming style algorithm exhibits a subcubic time complexity for the Dyck language with k kinds of parentheses. When the underlying graphs are restricted to bidirected trees, an algorithm with O(n log n log k) time complexity was proposed recently. This paper studies the Dyck-CFL-reachability problems on bidirected trees and graphs. In particular, it presents two fast algorithms with O(n) and O(n + m log m) time complexities on trees and graphs respectively. We have implemented and evaluated our algorithms on a state-of-the-art alias analysis for Java. Results on standard benchmarks show that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude speedup and consume less memory.},

    abstract = {Recursive state machines (RSMs) enhance the power of ordinary state machines by allowing vertices to correspond either to ordinary states or to potentially recursive invocations of other state machines. RSMs can model the control flow in sequential imperative programs containing recursive procedure calls. They can be viewed as a visual notation extending Statecharts-like hierarchical state machines, where concurrency is disallowed but recursion is allowed. They are also related to various models of pushdown systems studied in the verification and program analysis communities.After introducing RSMs and comparing their expressiveness with other models, we focus on whether verification can be efficiently performed for RSMs. Our first goal is to examine the verification of linear time properties of RSMs. We begin this study by dealing with two key components for algorithmic analysis and model checking, namely, reachability (Is a target state reachable from initial states?) and cycle detection (Is there a reachable cycle containing an accepting state?). We show that both these problems can be solved in time O(nθ2) and space O(nθ), where n is the size of the recursive machine and θ is the maximum, over all component state machines, of the minimum of the number of entries and the number of exits of each component. From this, we easily derive algorithms for linear time temporal logic model checking with the same complexity in the model. We then turn to properties in the branching time logic CTL*, and again demonstrate a bound linear in the size of the state machine, but only for the case of RSMs with a single exit node.},

    abstract = {A fundamental query in labeled graphs is to determine if there exists a path between a given source and target vertices, such that the path satisfies a given label constraint. One of the powerful forms of specifying label constraints is through regular expressions, and the resulting problem of reachability queries under regular simple paths (RSP) form the core of many practical graph query languages such as SPARQL from W3C, Cypher of Neo4J, Oracle's PGQL and LDBC's G-CORE. Despite its importance, since it is known that answering RSP queries is NP-Hard, there are no scalable and practical solutions for answering reachability with full-range of regular expressions as constraints. In this paper, we circumvent this computational bottleneck by designing a random-walk based sampling algorithm called ARRIVAL, which is backed by theoretical guarantees on its expected quality. Extensive experiments on billion-sized real graph datasets with thousands of labels show that ARRIVAL to be 100 times faster than baseline strategies with an average accuracy of 95%.},
