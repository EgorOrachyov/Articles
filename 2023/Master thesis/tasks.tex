\section{Problem statement}

The goal of this work is the implementation of the generalized sparse linear algebra primitives and operations library with portable vendor-agnostic yet high-performance GPUs accelerated computations. The work can be divided into the following tasks.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Conduct the survey of existing solutions, focusing on design principles and programming model, overview technologies and tools for programming GPU computations and highlight challenges of GPU programming.
    
    \item Develop the architecture of the library. Design the high-level library structure, execution model, storage scheme, GPUs backend for vendor-agnostic and portable computations acceleration.
    
    \item Implement the library according to the developed architecture, including library core, backend for GPUs accelerated computations, some GPU optimizations in order to speedup computations, and a set of common graph algorithms.

    % and a high-level package for library distribution.
    
    \item Conduct the preliminary experimental study of implemented artifacts. Analyse the performance of the proposed solution compared to existing tools, test the portability and scalability of the developed library on GPUs of different device vendors.
\end{itemize}
