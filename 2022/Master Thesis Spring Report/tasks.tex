\section{Problem statement}

The goal of this work is the implementation of the generalized sparse linear algebra primitives and operations library for GPU computations. The work can be divided into the following tasks.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Conduct the survey of existing solutions.
    \item Conduct the survey of instruments and technologies for GPU programming.
    \item Develop the architecture of the library.
    \item Implement the library accordingly to the developed architecture.
    \item Implement a set of most common graph algorithms using library.
    \item Conduct experimental study of implemented artifacts. 
\end{itemize}
